# hello-world

Hi to everyone !
I'm a newbie in GitHub and I hope to improve my programming skills very rapidly in order to publish some software of quality! As you can see also my English is not so mature but I'm studying as much as I can to speak to the entire world in this language!
Here I put some "Hello world"s from different languages I know,
Bye !
